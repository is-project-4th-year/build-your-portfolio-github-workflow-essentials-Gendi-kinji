## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

Write about **4 things** you expected to learn during the Git crash course (yes, we all came in with some big hopes ðŸ˜…).
For each one, mention:

What you thought it would be like **(Expectation ðŸ‘€)**

What you actually learned **(Reality ðŸ˜…)**

And how it helped with your personal portfolio project ðŸ’»

make it honestâ€”and if it surprised you, even better!

Example format:

**ðŸ§  What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**
**1. Concept: Issues**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I thought issuing was used to handle bugs in the project.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: It turns out that issues are used to clearly define what you would specifically do in the projects

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I created 6 issues according to what was needed for the portfolio such as document alignment.

**2. Concept: GitHub Actions**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I thought they were easily automated and intuitive to use.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Turns out I needed to learn the YAML language to understand how to implement them.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I created a YAML file to send notifications upon pushing of a commit.

**3. Concept: Branching**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I thought branching was focused on collaborative projects.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Turns out even solo projects need branches.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I created a branch for each issue that I created for the project.

**4. Concept: Conventional commits**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I thought commits were general.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Turns out that commits are divided depending on the changes that you have made to the repository.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I made meaningful commit messages based on the changes I made to the portfolio.

## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features

Include screenshots that demonstrate how you used GitHub to manage your project. For each screenshot, write a short caption explaining what it shows.

> Upload the screenshots to your GitHub repository and reference them here using Markdown image syntax:
